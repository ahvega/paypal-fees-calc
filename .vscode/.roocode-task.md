# Roo Code Task

Create a PayPal Fees Calculator webapp that replicates the logic from @/paypal-price.py using modern web technologies. Requirements:

1. Technical Stack:

- Core: Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, ES6 JavaScript
- UI Framework: Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI components
- Optional Enhancement Suggestion: Propose Next.js (TypeScript) + Shadcn/ui for production-grade implementation

2. Interface Requirements:

- Responsive dark-first design with daisyui dark theme
- Dynamic light/dark toggle with system preference detection
- Clean dashboard layout with card-based components
- Real-time fee calculation updates via input listeners
- Animated number transitions for results

3. Functional Components:

- Currency selector dropdown with flags
- Payment type radio (Standard vs Micropayment rates)
- Amount input with currency formatting
- Fee breakdown modal with formula explanation
- Validation: Numeric limits, required fields, error messages
- Result card group showing net amount, fees, and total

4. UI Elements:

- daisyui input groups with addon labels
- Custom range slider for amount adjustments
- Theme-aware charts.js visualization for fee distribution
- Animated loading state during calculations
- Interactive tooltips for rate explanations

Include: Input sanitization, localStorage for preferences, print-friendly styles, PWA capabilities, and comprehensive form validation. For advanced implementation, suggest a Next.js 14 App Router version with react-hook-form, zod validation, and headless UI components.

To create the PayPal Fees Calculator webapp based on the Python script, I'll need to:

Analyze the existing Python logic for fee calculations and data structures
Map the CLI input flow to a modern web UI with form validation
Implement the core calculation logic in JavaScript
Create responsive UI components using DaisyUI/Tailwind
Add dynamic updates and animations
Implement theme handling and PWA features

First steps:

Create index.html as the main entry point
Add required CSS/JS dependencies via CDN
Structure the UI components based on DaisyUI examples
Port country/currency data from Python to JS
Implement calculation logic with input validation
